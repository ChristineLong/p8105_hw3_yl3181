#Problem 1
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

#Import and organize dataset including cleaning names, filter certain obs and change variable type
brfss = janitor::clean_names(brfss_smart2010) %>% 
        filter(topic == "Overall Health" & response == c("Excellent", "Poor")) %>% 
        mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent","Poor")))

#Group datasets by years and locations for following analyses
